Appendix - GitLab runners
-------------------------

Linux
~~~~~

The runner for Linux is registered following instructions reported
`here <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/#linux>`_, on a machine with the following properties:

- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6252 CPU @ 2.1 GHz, 1 Core
- 51 GB RAM
- 50 GB space on disk

While registering the runner, ``docker`` is chosen as executor and jobs are run on the ``miniconda3-centos7:latest``
image.


Windows
~~~~~~~

The runner for Windows is registered following instructions reported
`here <https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/#windows>`_, on a machine with the following properties:

- Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6132 CPU @ 2.60 GHz, 4 Cores
- 32 GB RAM
- 149 GB space on disk

While registering the runner, ``shell`` is chosen as executor. The ``shell`` of choice is ``powershell``.

``Visual Studio Community 2022`` is required for the build stage, and it is installed on the runner as described
`here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17>`_. The following
additional ``Visual Studio`` workloads are also required:

- ``Desktop development with C++`` (with optional package ``C++ CMake tools for Windows``);
- ``Universal Windows Platform development``

The standard ``shell`` environment is set using the script ``vcvars64.bat`` for compiling the package at 64-bit, or the
script ``vcvars32.bat`` for compiling the package at 32-bit. Both the scripts are provided by
``Visual Studio Community 2022``. Also, to compile the package at 32-bit the ``shell`` environment variable
``CONDA_FORCE_32BIT`` must be set to 1.
