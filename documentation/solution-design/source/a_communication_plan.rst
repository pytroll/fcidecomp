Appendix - Communication plan
-----------------------------

In order to keep :ref:`FCIDECOMP software stakeholders <fcidecomp_stakeholders>` updated, communication is established
with them as soon as the open source canonical repository, new packages and related documentation are available.

Priority is given to :ref:`EUMETSAT <sh_eumetsat>` and the :ref:`HDF Group <sh_hdfgroup>`, as they are the main
distribution channels of the software itself and of information related to it. Communication with the ``hdf5plugin``
package maintainers is also important and, as described in :ref:`a_integration_with_hdf5plugin`, is initiated in the
early stage of the solution development process.

Finally, for each new release on the open source FCIDECOMP repository emails are sent to the HDF Group and to
EUMETSAT user support service, which in turns uses its communication channels to directly update MTG users.
