Appendix - Design justifications
--------------------------------

Choice of supported OS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of supported OS reported in the :ref:`supported_platforms` paragraph is based upon the list reported
in the :ref:`EUMETCast Operating System Specification page <[EUMETCAST_OS_SPEC]>`, where only OS which have not yet
reached their EOL (and which are neither approaching it) have been retained.

Generic integration with Unidata netCDF-JAVA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generic integration with :ref:`Unidata netCDF-JAVA based tools <[NETCDF_JAVA]>` is not a straightforward task, and
at the moment it is not considered a priority. Nonetheless, communication with Unidata developers has been initiated
to know of any development regarding the possibility to use third-party decompression filters such as the FCIDECOMP
software.
