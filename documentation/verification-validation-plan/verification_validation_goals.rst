Verification and Validation Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This section describes the goals of the verification and validation activities.

The goals are listed below; if a goal only refers to verification or validation, this is explicitly stated.
The strategies adopted to reach such goals are described in the following sections.

VG1.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software can be used to decompress FCI L1c NRT data via command line tools.

VG2.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software can be used to decompress FCI L1c NRT data via Python.

VG3.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software can be used to decompress FCI L1c NRT data via selected
    Java software (Panoply).

VG4.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software can be used to decompress FCI L1c NRT data via the Data Tailor Software.

VG5.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software only uses software that is licensed in a way that is
    compatible with any use, i.e. free and open source software, and any dependencies to be archived
    at EUMETSAT.

VG6.
    Ensure the FCIDECOMP software can be installed using a dependencies archive hosted on EUMETSAT Gitlab.

All the goals are intended to be achieved on all the applicable platforms
(MTG user stations that match the approved baseline).
