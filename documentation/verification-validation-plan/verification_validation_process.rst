Software V&V Process Overview and Planning
------------------------------------------

Organization of V&V Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V&V activities for the FCIDECOMP software are organized in the following phases:

-  the definition of a V&V plan (this document), which:

   -  identifies the goals and the scope of the activities;

   -  specifies the V&V strategy;

   -  defines the V&V methods;

   -  outlines the test specification design;

-  the definition of V&V specifications :ref:`[FCIDECOMP_TP] <[FCIDECOMP_TP]>`, in the form of:

   -  test cases, which aim at
      validating specific features or expected failures;

   -  test procedures specify for each test case the actions to be
      executed and the expected results;

-  the definition of the Verification Control Document :ref:`[FCIDECOMP_VCD] <[FCIDECOMP_VCD]>`, to detail, for each
   requirement in :ref:`[FCIDECOMP_WP] <[FCIDECOMP_WP]>`:

   -  the verification methods;

   -  verification notes, e.g. consulting with experts i.e. security and QA teams;

   -  the software version first implementing the requirement;

   -  the traceability between system requirements and the items verifying it
      (test cases, chapters of a document);

   -  test procedure automation flag (if applicable);

   -  notes;

   -  latest Test or Review-of-design Report;

   -  latest Report date;

   -  validated/verified flag;

-  the execution of the procedures and the recording of the results in a
   test report. This phase includes one or more on-factory (dry-run)
   test sessions, and is used for the official validation.

Test Plan
~~~~~~~~~

All the test procedures are performed upon completion of the source code and documentation
delivery milestone.

Schedule of the Verification and Validation Activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FCIDECOMP software source code is hosted at EUMETSAT GitLab instance
at https://gitlab.eumetsat.int/sepdssme/fcidecomp  .

V&V activities are executed as
detailed in the following table.

      - 2 hours
    * - Test readiness review

    * - On-site acceptance tests

      - 1 hour

Anomaly reports mechanism
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Anomalies detected during the execution of tests
are tracked as issues in the FCIDECOMP GitLab instance,
with a target date for resolution.
Links to the issues are reported in the relevant test reports.

Responsibilities and Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following roles are required for completion of the V&V activities.
The :ref:`Table <table_responsibilities_and_roles>` outlines which individuals
from which organisations fulfil these roles.

Other Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V&V activities also require the following resources to be setup in advance.
Test specifications (test cases) specify additional software pre-requisites which do not need to be
setup in advance.

.. note:: On-site acceptance tests can be executed on the same machine as in the FAT, under the assumption
    that the FCIDECOMP software is made available as read-only and the publishing server can be deployed as a Docker
    container.
