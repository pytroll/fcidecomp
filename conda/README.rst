EUMETSAT FCIDECOMP Conda recipe
===============================

Manual build and installation instructions
------------------------------------------

The FCIDECOMP software can be manually built as a ``conda`` package and installed using the provided ``conda`` recipe.

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build of the ``conda`` package and its installation require:

- ``conda``, installed as described
  `here <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html>`_

- ``conda-build``, installed as described `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/>`_

- a connection to internet

Build on platform Windows require also:

- ``Visual Studio Community 2022``, installed as described
  `here <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=17>`_
  (make sure to install on default location 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community')

- install also these Visual Studio workloads:

  - Desktop development with C++ (with optional package "C++ CMake tools for Windows")
  - Universal Windows Platform development

Conda package build and install on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the ``conda`` package, run the following command from within the ``conda`` directory (replace $BUILD_DIRECTORY
with the path to the directory where ``conda`` packages will be dumped)::

    conda build . --output-folder $BUILD_DIRECTORY

Once ``conda`` packages have been successfully built, create a new ``conda`` environment. Let's call it ``fcidecomp``, but
any valid name would do (change the following instructions accordingly)::

    conda create -n fcidecomp python=3.7

Activate the environment::

    conda activate fcidecomp

Execute::

    conda install -y --override-channels -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c $BUILD_DIRECTORY fcidecomp

Conda package build and install on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From the Windows menu `Start`, select the Visual 2022 folder, then open the
proper command prompt:

 - x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (to build for platform 64bit)
 - x86 Native Tools Command Prompt (to build for platform 32bit)

Then, only in case of building for platform 32bit, type::

    set CONDA_FORCE_32BIT=1

To build the ``conda`` package, run the following command from within the ``conda`` directory (replace %BUILD_DIRECTORY%
with the path to the directory where ``conda`` packages will be dumped)::

    conda build . --output-folder %BUILD_DIRECTORY%

Once ``conda`` packages have been successfully built, create a new ``conda`` environment. Let's call it ``fcidecomp``, but
any valid name would do (change the following instructions accordingly)::

    conda create -n fcidecomp python=3.7

Activate the environment::

    conda activate fcidecomp

Execute::

    conda install -y --override-channels -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c %BUILD_DIRECTORY% fcidecomp
