# - Find CharLS, an optimized JPEG-LS compression library
#
# To provide the module with a hint about where to find your CharLS
# installation, you can set the environment variable CHARLS_ROOT.  The
# Find module will then look in this path when searching for CharLS
# paths, and libraries.
#
# This module will define the following variables:
# CHARLS_FOUND       - Indicates whether the library has been found at all
# CHARLS_LIBRARY     - Name of the library to link
# CHARLS_INCLUDE_DIR - Path to the header files to include
#
